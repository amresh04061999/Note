1 Sale in Dynamic 365
 Account: An account is an organization. this includes customer, vendor, partne, Affiliate, or anyone.
          when you're doing business with any company then you capture those companies' details here, in the accounts entity.
          So whenever I say entity, entity is nothing but a place where you can store the records or store the data. 
 Contact:  The contact is an individual. A contact is also your customer but it is a person and a contact can be associated with a maximum of one account which is called its primary contact.
           So for any company whom you are doing business with you will need a person whom you are going to interact with. So that becomes your primary contact. So you can associate a contact with an account. Contact and account are your customers. 
         Accounts are organizations and contacts are individuals.

 Lead: Lead is a prospect and it can be your potential customer or your potential sale. So whenever you meet someone they give you a business card or they give you some information about them.
       So that becomes your lead. So you capture those leads in your Dynamics 365 sales module and it can be a potential customer.
       It means the person who has never done business before with you and they are meeting it for the
       first time so can be a potential customer and it can be a potential sale as well. It means the customer is existing but there is a new opportunity and they want to work with you. Right! So
       that can become your potential sales. So every sales process starts with a lead generation or leads that you interact with them and you start following up with them. So lead is a prospect.

 Opportunity: So opportunity is a potential sale. It means that the lead is almost ready to buy  So when you have the lead ready it means they ask you for more information and it means that they are
              interested and they are ready to buy. And you can create opportunities manually also. So you don't have to follow the lead-to-opportunity process but you can also create an opportunity
              directly in the system. And it is attached to an account or contact because you should know whom you are going to sell. There you identified the customer needs, what are the pain points they have, what exactly the solution
              they are looking for, and what solution you have proposed to them. So you capture all those details in opportunity. So opportunity is your potential sale which is the next step of lead.

Quote: So quote is a document for Prospect and Customer with all the details. So when your lead is ready to buy that becomes your opportunity and when your prospect is interested in your product and services they ask you for a quote.
       So quote includes a product they want to purchase, the quantity that they are looking at, the price that you are offering to them, payment terms that you have defined, and other important details that you capture in quote.
       So once you have the quote in place, you can send it to the customer and then basically they can take the decision. How do they go about it?
         So quote is a document for Prospect and customers with all the details that are offered to them.

Orders: orders are a confirmation from customers that they are purchasing your product or services. So it can be created from the quote. It means you don't have to manually
       enter it again if the quote is available, all you can do is, create the order from the quote and all the information that is there in the quote will get transferred to the order. It can also be created manually.
       So you don't have to follow the entire process. In case the customer is interested and they are giving you the order, you can directly create an order in Dynamics 365 for sales.
       The next is an invoice. So it is a document that you use to bill your customer for using your product and services.

 Invoice: So it is a document that you use to bill your customer for using your product and services. So it is sent to the customer once you have fulfilled the order. So once you get the order you fulfill the requirements, you fulfill what you have promised them, it means
          you deliver your services or you deliver that if you are doing training that you deliver the training. Once it is finished, you send them an invoice. Sending an invoice ensures that the customer is going to
          pay you for the services that they use. It can also be created manually. It means you don't have to follow the entire process of lead, opportunity, quote, order, and invoice. You can directly create an invoice. In case if you have a repeated customer and they're using your services regularly.
          So you can create the invoice manually and bill any customer. 

 Competitors: So it's a place where you capture all your competitor's details. So when you are bidding for any project, if some other company is also bidding for the same project then you should know that OK what they're good at, what they are about and what are their strengths, what are
              their weaknesses, what is the product offering they have and what quality they have. Right! So all those kinds of information you can capture in competitors and you can attach it with your sales process.
              So you will know that I'm competing with this competitor which has these qualities, these are weaknesses.So you can keep track of them and then you can win because once you know what their weaknesses
              are or what their qualities are, you can make changes to your offering accordingly and give it to the customers to win the lead. So understanding competitors is very very important in the business.


    Sales literature: It's a centralized repository for sales documents and this can include the brochures, the brochures that you have, and the product guide. So if you have multiple products then what the specifications of the products
                      and what guides are available, so, that you can give them to the customer and they can see their complete specification. You can also capture your competitor's information. You can also have pricing and discounts details in the sales repository and other sales documents.
                      So sales literature is a centralized repository of sales documents.


 Product catalogs: So product catalog is a collection of products and their pricing information. When you have any product or services you can create that under product. You can define the unit,it means that for a particular product
                 how do you sell it, how do you purchase it.
                 For example, a PC can be sold in numbers and if you are sending your training services then you can charge customers on an hourly basis. So you can define an hour as a unit group. So there you can capture their unit groups.
                 You can define a price list according to the segmentation of your customers. So you can define multiple price lists for different customers you can also define discount lists. So in case if somebody buys from 0 to 10 it means you will get
                 a 5 percent discount, if they buy from 11 to 25, then you get 20 percent discount. Right!So those kind of discounts you can define in the discount list.So the entire product-related configuration, pricing, product details, discounts everything is captured and
                maintained in the product catalog.

 Goals: So goals are used to keep track of the progress on achieving your targets. Whatever revenue that you have planned for the particular quarter or year or half year, you can keep track of those goals here.
        So you can define your goal details that okay what exactly the goal is. So for example a goal can be that a sales manager needs to meet his hundred thousand U.S. dollar targetin this quarter.
        So those are going to be fine. You can define the period type, you can define the goal revenue target, and how much you want to achieve. And also the actual goal that you can keep track of.
        So as soon as the opportunities are closed, you will see that the actual sales are making. 
        So for example the target is 100000 dollars and your team has closed an opportunity worth $20000. Then you would know that OK this is the plan I have, a hundred thousand dollars and 20000 is already closed.
        So this is automatically calculated by the application and gives you a real-time picture of how you're performing on your goals.

Goal metrics: What is a goal metric side whether it is count or amount? So for sales, it is going to be an amount.
             For example, if you want to see how many calls the person has made in a day then that becomes your count. So you can define those metrics to measure goals. You can also create a rollup field for 
             calculation. So as you have seen in the goals actual revenue is calculated through roll-up fields.
             So you can define those roll-up fields for calculation of whether it's going to be some of all the opportunities that are with status won or some of all the opportunities that are closed.
             So those things you can define the roll-up fields.

Dynamics 365 sale process flow 

Start: lead > Opportunity > Sales Quote > Sales Oreder > Sale Invoice
      Lead Qualification
     Account <> contact

So the first step in the process is to create a lead. two things lead to your potential sale or a potential customer.
So first step is to create a lead in Dynamics 365. And then once the lead shows interest in your product or services and asks for more information it means
they are interested. So when they're interested you qualify that lead and that becomes your opportunity. This process is called lead qualification.

So as soon as you do lead qualification two things happen, whatever information of an individual you have captured in the lead becomes contact, and whatever information you have captured as a company it means the company details that become your account.

So it's an automatic process. You don't have to manually create a contact or account from the lead and if existing accounts or contacts are available for that particular lead then the system is going to pick that automatically. So it is not going to create a duplicate.

So once you have the opportunity it means you have shared the details with the customer. So they ask you for more information, so you add all the products in the opportunity, all the prices, all the things you define the opportunity and create a quotation.

So when you create a quotation you might need to create multiple versions because customers might negotiate with you. So you defined the quote, you created the quote and you sent it to the customer.
If they ask for some changes you negotiate with them and then you revise the quote, so you can keep a limited number of revisions. And it is not going to delete the previous one, it is going to keep the previous one for history.
So the sales quote is created.

Once the prospect says yes I'm interested in this product service and I like the quote. So I want to go ahead with this. What do you do, you convert that quotation to an order. It means it's a confirmation from the customer and the order is created.

So what happens in the background the system automatically closes the opportunity as won and it creates order. So once you get the confirmation from the customer and they send you the purchase order that becomes
your sales order and after you receive the purchase order from them you deliver whatever you have promised. So it can be a training, it can be a product, it can be any service that you have delivered to the customer.
So once you have delivered what you have promised the customer it's time to send them an invoice. It means the work is finished and you are sending the invoice so that they can make payment.

Marketing :
           The first terminology you should know is about marketing lists. So, a marketing list allows you to group your accounts, contacts, or leads for marketing.
           for example, You have two marketing lists. Marketing List One has all the people interested in product A and Marketing List Two has all the people interested in product B.
           So if you want to communicate with the people who are interested in product A, you will send an email or communication to marketing list 1. So marketing lists allow you to group the contacts, accounts, or leads together to 
           together to differentiate OK! What they are interested in. You can either choose it from an account, contact, or leads.
           You cannot choose multiple in the same marketing list. So if you create one marketing list it can be either of the accounts. It means you can add all the accounts, you can be the contacts.
           It means you can enter only contacts there and it can be lead where you can enter only leads or select only that marketing list.

There are two types of marketing lists: One is dynamic and one is static. So in static, we enter all the members manually in the list, 
                                        in dynamic where you define a criteria that whenever somebody meets that criteria or parameters, it automatically gets added to your list.

Marketing Process in Dynamics 365

The marketing process in Dynamics 365 begins with careful planning and progresses through execution and lead generation, ultimately feeding into the sales process. Here's how it works:

1. Campaign Planning:

Objective: The first step is to plan what you want to market. This could be a product, a new launch, or a special offer.
Campaign Creation: You need to create a campaign in Dynamics 365 that aligns with your marketing objectives.
2. Attaching Marketing Lists:

Target Audience: Once your campaign is set up, the next step is to attach marketing lists.
Multiple Lists: These lists consist of people who are interested in the types of promotions you’re running. You can attach multiple marketing lists to a single campaign to reach a broader audience.
3. Defining Marketing Activities:

Activity Planning: After attaching the marketing lists, you need to define the marketing activities for your campaign.
Examples of Activities: These could include sending promotional emails, reminder emails, making phone calls, or sending discount codes. Each activity should be clearly outlined in this step.
4. Budget Allocation:

Budget Planning: Define the budget for each marketing activity as well as for the overall campaign.
Tracking Costs: As you execute the campaign, Dynamics 365 will track the actual costs against your budget, allowing you to monitor how much of your budget has been consumed.
5. Executing the Campaign:

Step-by-Step Execution: Start executing the defined marketing activities according to the schedule and priorities you’ve set.
Activity Example: If a campaign activity involves making phone calls, the system will create tasks for each customer on the list and assign them to the relevant team members.
6. Campaign Responses and Lead Generation:

Handling Responses: As customers respond to your calls, emails, or other follow-ups, these responses are tracked as campaign responses.
Converting Responses: Campaign responses can be converted into leads, which then move into the sales process.
7. Transition to Sales Process:

Sales Process: Once leads are generated from your campaign, they are matured through the sales process. This involves creating opportunities, generating quotations, and eventually creating invoices.
End-to-End Integration: The marketing process seamlessly transitions into the sales process, ensuring continuity and efficiency in managing customer interactions and business transactions.
